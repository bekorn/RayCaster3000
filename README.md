## RayCaster3000
You can get a cool render if you feed it with correct instructions.

Things you can play with:
+ Ambient and Point lights
+ Sphere objects
+ Materials with varying properties like reflectivity

For more detailed information on how to use it (and some slick renders), see INFO folder.

I might add planes and triangles to RayCaster3100, who knows.
